The course content introduces the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its evolution over time.

Understanding AI

AI is defined as augmented intelligence, which enhances human capabilities and automates tasks.
The history of AI dates back to the 1950s, with significant milestones including the Turing Test and the development of machine learning and deep learning.
Types of AI

AI can be categorized based on strength: weak AI (narrow AI) performs specific tasks, strong AI (generalized AI) can learn and adapt to new tasks, and super AI (conscious AI) would possess human-level consciousness.
Examples of weak AI include virtual assistants and recommendation engines, while strong AI can handle diverse tasks across various domains.
AI's Interdisciplinary Nature

AI integrates multiple fields such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, and philosophy, influencing its development and ethical considerations.
The course emphasizes the importance of understanding AI's applications and implications in society, highlighting its role in decision-making and innovation.

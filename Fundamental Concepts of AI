Core Concepts of Cognitive Computing

Perception: Machines gather and interpret data from various sources, helping them understand their environment.
Learning: Using machine learning algorithms, cognitive systems analyze data to identify patterns and trends, improving their understanding over time.
Reasoning: These systems make predictions and decisions based on the analyzed data, similar to human reasoning.
Benefits and Applications

Improved Decision-Making: Cognitive computing enhances decision-making by analyzing large datasets quickly.
Increased Efficiency: It automates tasks, saving time and resources.
Human-Machine Interaction: Natural language processing allows for more interactive communication between humans and machines.
Real-World Examples

Companies like IBM, Google, and Amazon utilize cognitive computing in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and customer service, to enhance their operations and services.


v2 - TERMINOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS OF AI

Understanding AI

AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
AI is categorized into three types: narrow AI (specific tasks), general AI (human-like cognitive abilities), and super AI (theoretical, surpassing human intelligence).
Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to analyze data and make decisions without explicit programming, enabling autonomous problem-solving.
Deep learning, a specialized subset of machine learning, employs multi-layered neural networks to analyze complex data and simulate human decision-making.
Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes organized in three layers: input, hidden, and output.
These networks process raw data, perform complex computations, and produce results, contributing to the overall functionality of AI systems.
